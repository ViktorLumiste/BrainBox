                comprehensive process, including editing and reviewing before delivery.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Translator translates written text.</li>
                <li>Interpreter translates oral speech.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Machine translation post-editing – editing machine-generated translation by a human.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Light post-editing (LPE) – post-editing of machine translation carried out to produce a text that is
                    merely
                    comprehensible, but nowhere close to human translation. The aim is to convey the content of the
                    original
                    text very accurately, without adding or omitting anything, while ensuring that all sentences
                    correspond to
                    the original and are unambiguous. However, errors in grammar, wording, and style are not corrected
                    as part
                    of LPE.
                </li>
                <li>Full post-editing (FPE) – post-editing of machine translation carried out to obtain a result
                    comparable to
                    that of human translation. The aim is to create a translation that is accurate, comprehensible, and
                    stylistically correct, with proper wording, grammar, and punctuation.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Source text / original text – text translated into another language.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Translation text – source text that has been translated in the target language.</li>
                <li>Source language – language of the source text.</li>
                <li>Target language – language into which the text is translated.</li>
                <li>Translation service – written translation that includes editing, terminologist work, and delivery
                    review.
                </li>
                <li>Translation volume – the volume of written translations, editing, and proofreading is calculated
                    based on
                    the number of characters in the translation text. One page consists of 1,800 characters, including
                    spaces.
                    You can calculate the number of characters in Microsoft Word by choosing Tools > Word count >
                    Characters
                    (with spaces), and by dividing this number with 1,800. This is the number of pages in your text.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Interpreting service – oral translation that falls under three types: whispered interpreting,
                    interpreting and simultaneous interpreting.
                </li>

                <li>Simultaneous interpreting – an interpreter speaks simultaneously with the speaker. The interpreter
                    works
                    in a separate cubicle and the translation is transmitted in the listeners’ earphones at practically
                    synchronously with the speaker’s text. Simultaneous interpreting usually involved two persons. The
                    other
                    translator who is currently not translating helps their colleague by listening to the speech and
                    notes
                    down
                    terms, numbers and names, and when needed, takes over.
                </li>

                <li>Consecutive interpreting – the speaker and interpreter speak in turns. A speaker makes a
                    presentation in
                    5-minute parts and the interpreter presents the same material in the target language as close as
                    possible to
                    the source text. The interpreter makes notes during the speech and whenever possible, uses a
                    slideshow
                    presentation.
                </li>

                <li>Whispered interpreting – the interpreter quietly translates for a small group of 2–3 people as the
                    lector
                    speaks.
                </li>

                <li>Layout/design – arranging the text, graphics and/or pictures so that the translation resembles the
                    original
                    as much as possible.
                </li>

                <li>Editing – ensuring that the target text is in accordance with the source text. During editing, it is
                    checked
                    whether the ideas of the original text are conveyed accurately and that no parts are omitted,
                    whether
                    the
                    sentences make sense and the terms used are correct, relevant and coherent.
                </li>

                <li>Proofreading – rereading the target text to verify that it is understandable and linguistically
                    correct.
                    Since the text is not compared to the source text, no changes are made to the content.
                </li>

                <li>Delivery review – overall checking of a translation, so that all parts of the source text are
                    translated
                    and
                    names/numbers in the text are correct and the format meets the requirements of the contracting
                    entity.
                </li>
            </ul>
